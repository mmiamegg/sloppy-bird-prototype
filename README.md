Attempt to practice Python by recreating Floppy Bird in Logo/Turtle Module


Purpose of the project:

Leaning Python by applying the programming concepts I have learned so far including the following:
  - Python basics and control flows
  - OOP
  - Logo/Turtle Module


Implemented Floppy Bird-like functionalities:
  - Move the character up and down to imitate jumping.
  - Generate random obstacles in the top and bottom of the screen to imitate the pipes that appear in Floppy Bird.
  - Detect when the player collides with a pipe and stop the game.


Future Implementations:
  - Create a basic 'Start Game' notice and basic instructions on the screen before the game starts.
  - Give score for every pipe the player passes.
  - Detect when the player hits the edge of the screen and display a 'Game Over' notice.
  - Save the last highest score on the local device.


Bugs to fix:
  - Improve the code for obstacle detection because only the top, bottom and left sides of the pipes are detected as collisions.
